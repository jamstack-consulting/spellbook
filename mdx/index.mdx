# Spellbook is your handy little bag of tricks.

MDX is changing what we can do with static sites.

This is mostly just a set of conventions that [liltechnomancer](https://technomancy.dev/) wants to use to make sites.

## Frontmatter driven pages.

You can do pretty nifty things with MDX, one of which is use
the frontmatter to drive the layout of the page.
Allowing you to make some awesome templates you can use, and then focus on writing some content.

<Button href="/posts/be-cool">Like this page.</Button>

Or you can use a combo of MDX components to hobble together a page for a quick prototype. Like the page you are on for example.

Look at the code below!
